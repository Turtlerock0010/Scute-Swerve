## About
Welcome to the Scute Swerve Repository! Here I will post development code and ready to release code to be used on a swerve module I am developing for MiniFRC! If you are looking for the most up to date file, please look no further to the `main.ino` file. This repository may not get too much attention but generally you can expect updates for during preseason prep, during season, and season closing.
